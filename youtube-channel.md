2. **Check the URL format**:
   - If the URL is `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - Then `UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` is the Channel ID

### Method 2: From Custom URL

If the channel uses a custom URL (like `https://www.youtube.com/@channelname`):

1. **Go to the channel page**
2. **Right-click on the page ‚Üí View Page Source**
3. **Search for `"channelId"`**
4. **Find content like this**:
   ```json
   "channelId":"UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

### Method 3: Using Online Tools

2. **Enter the channel URL or channel name**
3. **Get the Channel ID**

### Method 4: From Video Page

## ‚öôÔ∏è Monitoring Mechanism

### Check Frequency
- **Interval**: Checks once daily
- **Method**: Using YouTube RSS Feed
- **RSS URL Format**: `https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id={CHANNEL_ID}`

### Detection Logic

1. **New Video Detection**:
   - The bot fetches the latest video from the channel's RSS feed.
   - It compares the latest video's ID with the last recorded ID for that channel.
   - If the ID is new, a notification is sent, and the new ID is stored to prevent duplicate notifications.

### Data Storage

Monitoring settings are stored in `youtube_channels.json` file:

```json
[
  {
    "guildId": "Server ID",
    "channelId": "Discord Channel ID", 
    "youtubeChannelId": "YouTube Channel ID",
    "lastVideoId": "Last Video ID"
  }
]
```

## üì¢ Notification Format

### New Video Notification
```
New video upload! Channel Name: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
```
*The bot may respond in Traditional Chinese, e.g., `Êñ∞ÁöÑÂΩ±Áâá‰∏äÂÇ≥ÂõâÔºÅ` which means "New video upload!".*

### Notification Features

- ‚úÖ **Plain Link Format**: Easy to click and watch
- ‚úÖ **Daily Check**: Checks for new content once a day
- ‚úÖ **Channel Name**: Shows the actual YouTube channel name

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: What if Channel ID format is incorrect?

**A**: Ensure the Channel ID meets the following criteria:
- Starts with `UC`
- Total length of 24 characters
- Contains only alphanumeric characters

**Error Message**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid YouTube channel ID. Please check if the ID format is correct.
```

### Q2: Why am I not receiving notifications?

**Possible Reasons**:
1. **No new content**: The channel may not have uploaded a new video since the last daily check.
2. **RSS Feed delay**: YouTube's RSS feed can sometimes be delayed.
3. **Daily Check Schedule**: The bot checks once per day. You may need to wait up to 24 hours for a notification.
4. **Insufficient bot permissions**: Ensure the bot has message sending permissions in the target channel.
5. **Incorrect Channel ID**: Re-verify the Channel ID is correct.

### Q3: How many channels can be monitored?

**A**: There is no hard limit, but it's good practice to keep the number reasonable to ensure smooth operation. Monitoring is not resource-intensive as it only checks once per day.

### Q4: How to view currently monitored channels?

**A**: Currently no list command is available, but you can:
1. Check the `youtube_channels.json` file on the server where the bot is hosted.
2. Try adding the same channel again; if it's already being tracked, the bot will inform you.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Bot not responding to commands

**Solutions**:
1. Confirm bot is online.
2. Confirm you have administrator permissions on the server.
3. Confirm the command format is correct.
4. Re-invite the bot with the appropriate permissions if needed.

### Issue: Notification sending failed

**Check Items**:
1. **Bot Permissions**:
   - View channel
   - Send messages
   - Embed links

2. **Channel Status**:
   - Check if the channel was deleted or if the bot was kicked from the server.

3. **Log Check**:
   - The bot will log an error if it cannot find a channel, e.g., `YouTube monitoring: Channel {CHANNEL_ID} not found, removing from list.`

- `services/youtube/youtubeService.js` - YouTube API service
- `utils/youtubeStorage.js` - Data storage management
- `youtube_channels.json` - Monitoring configuration file

### API Limitations

- **YouTube RSS Feed**: No API Key is required, but it can have cache delays.
- **Update Frequency**: The bot checks once daily to be respectful to the service and avoid rate limits.

### Performance Considerations

- Each monitored channel sends one HTTP request per day, which has minimal performance impact.
- RSS parsing uses the `rss-parser` package.
- Data storage uses JSON files, which is suitable for small-to-medium scale use.
